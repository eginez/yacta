 # Yacta [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eginez/yacta.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eginez/yacta)
 This project is a prototype of an embedded DSL for a oracle cloud infrastructure

 Yacta is a tool for provisioning and modeling cloud infrastructure succinctly without loosing the flexibility of general
 programming languages.

 Yacta provides:

 - **Infrastructure as code**: Infrastructure is modeled with yacta's embedded dsl allowing for nicer abstractions but re-
 taining kotlin language constructs.
 - **Statically typed DSL**: Yacta's DSL is strongly typed thus Kotlin's compiler will verify your infrastrucute
 code before is deployed. Also by leveraging IntelliJ code completion features you can learn about different cloud
 resources on the fly
 - **Composable resources**: Sharing a resource is as easy as creating/consuming a java library. You resources can be
 composable and abstract away lower level parts of your infrastructure
